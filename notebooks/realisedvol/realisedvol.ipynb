    "There are many methods to measure risk. Volatility is one of these measures. In this study, we seek to understand how volatility behaves! We shall examine how sampling frequency impacts volatility measurements for EUR/USD using intraday data. Does measuring volatility using 5 minute data change the result compared to using 60 minute data? Also how do realised and implied volatility differ historically for S&P500? Lastly, we shall be demonstrating how to do a streaming data plot of EUR/USD.\n",

    "We shall be using Python, together with Plotly for plotting. Plotly is a free web-based platform for making graphs. You can keep graphs private, make them public, and run Plotly on your [Plotly Enterprise on your own servers](https://plot.ly/product/enterprise/). You can find more details [here](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/).\n",

    "We shall be using market data from Bloomberg (using Brian Smith's TIA wrapper) and Yahoo. We have also written the code to allow importation of market data from CSV files (for example if you've like to use intraday data from an FX broker). For more information on how to access Bloomberg via Python, please take a look at [this](https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/ukelectionbbg/), where I discussed how to use Bloomberg data to do an event study for price action around UK general elections. I have reused some of the code from that earlier project and also added a few extra features to some of that code. I have written this code for Python 2.7, although, much of it should work without too much modification if you are running Python 3.4+."

This is not necessarily the most \"accurate\" way to annualise volatility, but this approach tends to be most common in the market."
